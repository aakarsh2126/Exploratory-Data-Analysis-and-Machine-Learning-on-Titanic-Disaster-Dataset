# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-and-Machine-Learning-on-Titanic-Disaster-Dataset
Analyzing the titanic data set and creating machine learning models is the first step towards data science. This project is the first competition of Kaggle. I have implemented many models and also tried to use one of the Ensembling methods for better accuracy.
##  Models Used
### Logistic Regression
### K - Nearest Neighbours
### Decision Tree
### Random Forest
### Decision Tree with Hypertuning
### Support Vector Machines
### Perceptron
### Naive Bayes
### Stochastic Gradient Decent
### Stacking (Ensembling)
